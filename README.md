Why React?
1. React allows us to write composable code. What does "composable" mean?
   1. Composable means to create something larger with smaller pieces.
   2. In the context of React, this means condensing custom HTML into smaller, more-specific React components which can then be used interchangeably.
2. One can create React components as if they were a combination of JS `functions` and HTML.
